This laser beam hits one particular track (groove) of the disc, and as the disc rotates, the CD drive is able to read more of it. The differences in the way the laser beam is reflected off the CDâ€™s surface help the CD drive understand the data on it."

It is used to display images, text, video, and graphics information generated by a connected computer via a computer's video card. Although it is almost like a TV, its resolution is much higher than a TV. The first computer monitor was introduced on 1 March 1973, which was part of the Xerox Alto computer system,Older monitors were built by using a fluorescent screen and Cathode Ray Tube (CRT), which made them heavy and large in size and thus causing them to cover more space on the desk. Nowadays, all monitors are made up by using flat-panel display technology, commonly backlit with LEDs. These modern monitors take less space on the desk as compared to older CRT displays."

It is a peripheral device that is the most basic way for the user to communicate with a computer. It consists of multiple buttons, which create numbers, symbols, and letters, and special keys like the Windows and Alt key, including performing other functions. The design of the keyboard comes from the typewriter keyboards, and numbers and letters are arranged on the keyboard in that way, which helps to type quickly,The above keyboard design is called QWERTY design because of its first six letters across in the upper-left-hand corner of the keyboard. Although the keyboard design is derived from the typewrites, nowadays, it also includes many other keys as well as Alt/Option, Control, and Windows key can be used as shortcuts to perform the particular operation by combination with other keys. For example, if you press Control + S while working on a document in Microsoft Word, it will save the document you are working on. Furthermore, most of the keyboards have function keys (F1 to F12 or F16) at the top of the keyboard and arranged arrow keys in the downside used to perform numerous functions."

Furthermore, because most flatbed scanners have a cover that lifts up, they can scan books and other heavy things. A sheet-fed scanner is another type of scanner that is only able to accept paper documents. Although sheet-fed scanners have no capability of scanning books, some of their models include a feature of an automatic document feeder (ADF) that allows various pages to be scanned in sequence."

For a home network to work, both devices are necessary,Modem stands for Modulator/Demodulator. The modem is defined as a networking device that is used to connect devices connected in the network to the internet. The main function of a modem is to convert the analog signals that come from telephone wire into a digital form. In digital form, these converted signals are stored in the form of 0s and 1s. The modem can perform both the task of modulation and demodulation simultaneously. Modems are majorly used to transfer digital data in personal systems. The modem is also known as a signal translator as it translates one signal into another signal by modulating the digital signal into an analog signal for transmission and then demodulates receiving analog signals into digital signals."

If a packet reaches at one port, it is able to see by all the segments of the network due to a packet is copied to the other ports. A network hub has no routing tables or intelligence (unlike a network switch or router), which is used to send information and broadcast all network data across each and every connection,Although most of the hubs can recognize network troubles or errors like collisions, broadcasting all information to the several ports can be a security risk and cause bottlenecks. The network hubs were popular in the past time as they were cheaper as compared to a switch or router. Nowadays, switches are much cheaper than a hub and provide a better solution for any network. Furthermore, a hub is no IP address, as it is a dumb device."
